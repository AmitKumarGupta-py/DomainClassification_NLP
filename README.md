# DomainClassification_NLP

Domain classification in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the task of categorizing textual data into predefined domains or categories. This is crucial for applications such as e-commerce, customer support, content filtering, and recommendation systems.

Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning or deep learning model that accurately classifies product descriptions, user queries, or textual content into relevant domains, such as:

Electronics
Fashion & Apparel
Home & Furniture
Books & Stationery
Health & Beauty
Grocery & Food

Key Steps in the Project:

1: Data Collection & Preprocessing:

Cleaning text (removing stopwords, punctuation, etc.)
Tokenization & lemmatization
Handling class imbalance (if applicable)

2: Feature Engineering:

Traditional Methods: TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words
Deep Learning Methods: Word2Vec, FastText, BERT embeddings

3: Model Selection & Training:

Machine Learning: Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, RandomForestClassifier
Deep Learning: LSTMs, CNNs, Transformer-based models (BERT)

4: Model Evaluation & Optimization:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
Hyperparameter tuning for improved performance

5: Deployment:

Deploy the model as an API using Flask/Django, Gradio, Streamlit
Real-time classification for new text data

Challenges & Solutions:

Underfitting: Increase model complexity, improve feature representation
Overfitting: Regularization, dropout, more training data
Handling Ambiguous Text: Use contextual embeddings like BERT

* This project can be extended to various domains like News Classification, Customer Intent Recognition, and Chatbot Intent Detection.
